RULES:

    Live:
        Every counter with two or three neighboring
        counters survives for the next generation.
    
    Death:
        Each counter with four or more neighbors
        dies (is removed) from overpopulation.
        Every counter with one neighbor or none
        dies from isolation.

    Birth:
        Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three
        neighbors-no more, no fewer-is a birch cell.
        A counter is placed on it at the next move.
